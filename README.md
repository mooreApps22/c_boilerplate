# Boilerplate files for a new C Program
## This script will create Makefile, header files, and C files
This boilerplate is designed for a GNU/Linux system, but by adjusting the libraries you should be get it run on other systems.

### Instructions 

1. chmod +x boilerplate.sh
2. ./boilerplate.sh
3. cd new_project
4. make
5. ./hello_world <your name>

Once you've tested that the program works. You can customize the data structure and setup functions to and then focus on your program logic. 

Setup functions are validate_arg.c, init_data.c, free_data.c. 

This is useful for speeding up all the functions you generally make for each program, but it's also a good exercise and shell scripting.

Customize the file as you see fit. 

Hint: rm -rf new_program
- This will delete the new_program
